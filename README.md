# Dota2ItemsExcel

This is my first rust project and I am pleased with the status it is in. I will not keep this up to date and probably will not rewrite the ugly code for a while.

Fetches dota 2 items/heroes and creates a spreadsheet with data.
Also includes a interactive DPS spreadsheet.

To use:
1. Ensure that Dota2Data.xlsx & Dota2BuyDps.xlsm are next to Dota2Items.exe.
2. Execute Dota2Items.exe.
